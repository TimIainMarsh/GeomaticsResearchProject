\section{Previous Work}

Here is were you review previous work done in your field of research. The aim is to set the background against which your own work will be judged. Naturally you are expected to outline the state of the art.

\subsection{In-line equations}

In-line equations are equations embedded in your text. Here is an example of an in-line equation $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})}{n}$. See how the equation runs with the text? All in-line equations are enclosed within dollar signs.
