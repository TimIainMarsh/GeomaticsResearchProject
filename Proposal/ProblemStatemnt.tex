\section{Problem Statement}

Creating 3D wire frame models from laser scans of the interior of a building.

Currently point clouds are generally huge files and require certain programs for them to be opened, these programs are usually rather complex and may not be easy to use for the average end user. Therefore it is beneficial for us to make these point clouds into something that is usable and easy for non expert users to be able to make decisions with. A good way to do this is to turn the point cloud into a 3-dimensional wire frame model. A point cloud is a completely unstructured data set, where as a 3-dimensional model is very structures and is substantially
