\section*{Abstract}

The abstract goes here. The purpose of the abstract is to summarise the most important aspects of the document.

A reader will typically look at your document in this order

\begin{itemize}
\item Title

\item Abstract

\item Conclusion

\item Introduction

\item ... and so on
\end{itemize}


So your abstract should provide an overview of your paper emphasising on results and conclusions.


By the way above is an example of how to create a list.
