\section*{Abstract}

	With laser scanning becoming more and more popular as a form of surveying, it has become increasingly important for us to be able to process and make the resulting point clouds usable. This paper works with laser scans of the interior of buildings and making those point clouds usable and helpful.
	
	When a scan is taken of the inside of a room, it is useful to know what each point represents, be it the floor, ceiling or wall. This is done by segmenting and classifying the point cloud.
