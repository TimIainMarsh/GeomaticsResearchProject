	With laser scanning becoming more prominent as a form of surveying, it becomes increasingly important for us to be able to process the resulting point clouds and make sense of them. This Report takes indoor laser scans and attempts to create boundary representations of these laser scans using machine learning processes and algorithms.
	
	The need for boundary representations of rooms arises from engineering and architectural professions, where CAD models are needed of existing structures to facilitate future work on the buildings. Currently the best method for creating CAD models is by hand is CAD software but this is slow and potentially inaccurate.
	
	Point clouds are notoriously very large in terms of file size, the average boundary representation model is a fraction of the size with all the same relevant data.
