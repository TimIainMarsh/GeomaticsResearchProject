\section{Introduction}

%The reconstruction of precise surfaces from unorganized
%point clouds derived from laser scanner data or
%photogrammetric image measurements is a very hard
%problem, not completely solved and problematic in case of
%incomplete, noisy and sparse data.


3D representations of buildings vary largely in terms of how rigorously the models are structured. There are two extremes to it, the first is highly structured models, made in CAD software, of the buildings before or after the building has been built. The other end of the scale is 3D points clouds created by laser scanners that are entirely unstructured because they are just points floating in a 3D space. There is no relation from one point to another.

For taking surveying related measurements having just a point cloud works just fine, you can pick out specific points and do measurements across the points. But when it point clouds are used for applications like as built surveys of factories with the intention of the factory being expanded and/or up graded, a point cloud just wont cut it.

So it becomes necessary to create structure in these 3D points clouds. This is usually done by turning the point cloud into 3D models that engineers can then work on and use. There is an added advantage that some methods used for point cloud segmentation work with by classifying the points which allows for the 3D model to have labels.
