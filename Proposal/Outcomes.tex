The outcome of this paper will be to create an automatic system that creates 3D wire-frame models of the interior of a room/rooms in a building. 

So if a large point cloud that represents the whole interior of a building is fed through the program it will return a 3D wire-frame model of the interior of that building.

The program will be created in C++ using Point Cloud Library (PCL) and then be used as an add on function for existing point cloud software.
