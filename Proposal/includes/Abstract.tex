\section*{Abstract}

	With laser scanning becoming more and more popular as a form of surveying, it has become increasingly important for us to be able to process and make the resulting point clouds usable. This paper works with laser scans of the interior of buildings and making those point clouds usable and helpful.
	
	When a scan is taken of the inside of a room you get a point cloud of the scan. it is more useful to have that scan as a 3D model than as a point cloud. this paper deals with the process of taking a point cloud and generating a wire-frame model of that point cloud.
	
	A wire-frame model is an edge or skeletal representation of a real-world 3D object using lines and curves. Wire-frame models consist only of points, lines, and curves that describe the edges of the object. Effectively removing all but the important pieces of information.
