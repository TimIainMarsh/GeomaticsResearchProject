First and Foremost i would like to thank Dr. George Sithole for his guidance throughout this project. I'd also like to thank the Department of Geomatics and all the staff in for their input in this thesis and in everything that I have done from first year all the way through to culminate in this project.

Then I'd like to thank my family and friends for all their support throughout my university career, and for everything they have done for me in my life that lead me to where I am today.
